# US_BikeShare_Analysis
In this project, we will perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. We will compare the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. We will also see if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users.

Hello guys, feel free to download or clone my project. I'm a ML enthusiast, just starting on my journey. Any input to improve upon my work is appreciated.

Steps to follow to properly run my code:

1. Unzip the folders: data and examples
2. Make sure you have a jupyter notebook installed on your PC.
3. Just download the Bike_Share_Analysis_revised_3.ipnb file, keep it in the same folder as the data and examples folder, and open it up using the jupyter notebook. Voila!!

For details on how you could go ahead to document your work, check out my file Bike_Share_Analysis_revised_3.html

All the best.
